# MEDIUM Test Dataset Specification

## Configuration
- Employees: 20
- Shifts per day: 15
- Days: 5
- Total shifts: 75

## Characteristics
- Skills: Random 1-3 skills per employee from {SKILL1, SKILL2, SKILL3}
- Preferences: Random time preference {08:00, 16:00, 00:00}
- Vacations: 20% probability of 1-2 day vacation
- Sick leaves: 10% probability of 1-2 day sick leave
- Shift times: {08:00, 16:00, 00:00}
- Shift duration: 8 hours
- Locations: Random from {Location A, Location B, Location C, Location D}

## Expected Results
- Feasibility: Should find feasible solution (0hard score)
- Soft score: ~45-60 points
- Solve time: 5-10 seconds

## Algorithm Comparison
- Late Acceptance: Good performance, stable convergence
- Tabu Search: Better exploration, potentially higher soft score

## Generated by
DemoDataGenerator.generateConfigurableDataSet(20, 15, 5)
