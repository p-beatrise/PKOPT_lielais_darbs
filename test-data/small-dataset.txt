# SMALL Test Dataset Specification

## Configuration
- Employees: 5
- Shifts per day: 3
- Days: 3
- Total shifts: 9

## Characteristics
- Skills: Random 1-3 skills per employee from {SKILL1, SKILL2, SKILL3}
- Preferences: Random time preference {08:00, 16:00, 00:00}
- Vacations: 20% probability of 1-2 day vacation
- Sick leaves: 10% probability of 1-2 day sick leave
- Shift times: {08:00, 16:00, 00:00}
- Shift duration: 8 hours
- Locations: Random from {Location A, Location B, Location C, Location D}

## Expected Results
- Feasibility: Should find feasible solution (0hard score)
- Soft score: ~10-20 points
- Solve time: < 1 second

## Algorithm Comparison
- Late Acceptance: Stable, consistent results
- Tabu Search: Slightly better soft score, more exploration
