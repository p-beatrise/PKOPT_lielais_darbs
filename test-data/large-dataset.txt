# LARGE Test Dataset Specification

## Configuration
- Employees: 50
- Shifts per day: 30
- Days: 7
- Total shifts: 210

## Characteristics
- Skills: Random 1-3 skills per employee from {SKILL1, SKILL2, SKILL3}
- Preferences: Random time preference {08:00, 16:00, 00:00}
- Vacations: 20% probability of 1-2 day vacation
- Sick leaves: 10% probability of 1-2 day sick leave
- Shift times: {08:00, 16:00, 00:00}
- Shift duration: 8 hours
- Locations: Random from {Location A, Location B, Location C, Location D}

## Expected Results
- Feasibility: Should find feasible solution (0hard score)
- Soft score: ~100-140 points
- Solve time: 20-30 seconds

## Algorithm Comparison
- Late Acceptance: Consistent performance, faster early convergence
- Tabu Search: Better long-term optimization, higher final scores
